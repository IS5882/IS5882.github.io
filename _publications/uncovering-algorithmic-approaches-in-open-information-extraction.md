title: "Uncovering Algorithmic Approaches in Open Information Extraction"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/uncovering-algorithmic-approaches-in-open-information-extraction
excerpt: 'The explosion of mostly unstructured data has further motivated researchers to focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), hereby encouraging the development of Information Extraction (IE) techniques that target the retrieval of crucial information from unstructured texts. In this paper we present a literature review on Open Information Extraction (OIE). We compare both machine learning and handcrafted rules-based algorithmic approaches and identify the recently proposed Neural OIE approach as a particularly promising area for further research.'

The explosion of mostly unstructured data has further motivated researchers to focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP), hereby encouraging the development of Information Extraction (IE) techniques that target the retrieval of crucial information from unstructured texts. In this paper we present a literature review on Open Information Extraction (OIE). We compare both machine learning and handcrafted rules-based algorithmic approaches and identify the recently proposed Neural OIE approach as a particularly promising area for further research.
