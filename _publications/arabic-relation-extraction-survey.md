collection: publications
permalink: /publication/arabic-relation-extraction-survey
excerpt: 'Being the intersection between lexical and computational science, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been earning a vast amount of attention in the past years. Relation Extraction is a well-studied subject when it comes to English language. However, due to the complexity of the Arabic language, it is challenging to extract relations from Arabic text. The foremost goal of this paper is to discuss the major techniques used in Arabic relation extraction and investigate their strengths and weaknesses in order to guide future research towards creating an enhanced convenient relation extraction algorithm.'

Being the intersection between lexical and computational science, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been earning a vast amount of attention in the past years. Relation Extraction is a well-studied subject when it comes to English language. However, due to the complexity of the Arabic language, it is challenging to extract relations from Arabic text. The foremost goal of this paper is to discuss the major techniques used in Arabic relation extraction and investigate their strengths and weaknesses in order to guide future research towards creating an enhanced convenient relation extraction algorithm.
